# RockPaperScissor

This project is a digital adaptation of the hand game, where players compete by choosing between three symbolsâ€”rock, paper, and scissors.

In this version, players can compete against a bot or challenge real opponents, making the game both fun and engaging. The app is built using the Flutter framework and Firestore for real-time multiplayer interactions. With a user-friendly interface and smooth gameplay, this game is designed for quick experiences
